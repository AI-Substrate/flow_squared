## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Before building a universal code parser, we need empirical evidence about how tree-sitter parses diverse file formats—what's consistent, what varies, and whether a truly universal abstraction is feasible.

**Solution**: Create 16+ sample files across diverse formats (Python, JS, Markdown, Terraform, Dockerfile, etc.), generate raw JSON AST outputs using tree-sitter, and document patterns and inconsistencies to inform future production design.

**Expected Outcome**: A self-contained `initial_exploration/` folder with sample files, JSON outputs, exploration scripts, and a FINDINGS.md document that answers key design questions about universal parsing.

## Critical Research Findings

Research synthesized from `tree-sitter-research.md` and spec analysis:

| # | Impact | Finding | Action |
|---|--------|---------|--------|
| 01 | Critical | **Named vs Anonymous nodes**: `is_named` property universally distinguishes structural (grammar rules) from syntactic (punctuation) nodes | Use `is_named` filter as primary structural selector in exploration script |
| 02 | Critical | **tree-sitter-language-pack API**: Use `get_parser(language)` to get parser, `get_language(language)` for language object | Import from `tree_sitter_language_pack`, not individual grammar packages |
| 03 | Critical | **Text extraction**: Tree-sitter stores byte ranges, not text; use `source[node.start_byte:node.end_byte]` | Store source bytes and slice; don't rely on `node.text` property |
| 04 | High | **Common node patterns**: Most grammars use `*_definition`, `*_declaration`, `*_statement`, `*_block` naming | Look for these suffix patterns when analyzing outputs |
| 05 | High | **Field availability varies**: Some grammars have rich fields (`name`, `body`, `parameters`), others use flat children | Document which grammars have fields vs flat children in FINDINGS.md |
| 06 | High | **Markdown hierarchy uncertainty**: Some grammars use `section` nodes, others flat `atx_heading` | Test markdown grammar specifically to determine hierarchy approach |
| 07 | High | **Root node types vary**: `module` (Python), `program` (JS), `document` (Markdown), `source_file` (others) | Don't hardcode root expectations; observe and document per-grammar |
| 08 | Medium | **TreeCursor more efficient**: Use `node.walk()` cursor for traversal instead of recursive `children` iteration | Implement cursor-based traversal in exploration script |
| 09 | Medium | **Supertypes exist**: Grammars define `_declaration`, `_expression` supertypes grouping related nodes | Look for supertype patterns in node-types metadata if needed |
| 10 | Medium | **Error handling built-in**: `node.has_error` and `node.is_error` indicate parse failures | Include error flags in JSON output for debugging |
| 11 | Medium | **Language detection not included**: `tree-sitter-language-pack` doesn't map file extensions to languages | Build simple extension→language mapping table in script |
| 12 | Low | **HCL for Terraform**: Terraform files use `hcl` grammar, not `terraform` | Use `hcl` as language key for `.tf` files |
| 13 | Low | **Point vs byte coordinates**: `start_point`/`end_point` give row/column; `start_byte`/`end_byte` give offsets | Include both in JSON output for flexibility |

---

## Implementation

**Objective**: Generate sample files and JSON AST outputs for 16+ formats, creating a knowledge base to inform universal parser design.

**Testing Approach**: Manual Only (run scripts, inspect outputs visually)
**Mock Usage**: N/A (no mocks—real tree-sitter parsing only)

## Change Footnotes Ledger

[^1]: 2025-11-26 P0-T3: Discovered C# grammar is `csharp` (not `c_sharp`). All 16 target languages confirmed available. 172 total grammars in pack. See `initial_exploration/GRAMMAR_AVAILABILITY.md`.
[^2]: 2025-11-26 P1-T27: Markdown headings are FLAT `atx_heading` nodes, not nested `section` nodes. Post-processing needed to create hierarchical sections. See FINDINGS.md Q5.

---

**Status: COMPLETE**

All acceptance criteria met. See `initial_exploration/FINDINGS.md` for key insights:
- Universal abstraction is **feasible** with suffix-based type classification
- Markdown needs post-processing for section nesting
- TOML has no field names (use positional children)
- 8 distinct root types across 16 formats

**Next steps for production implementation:**
1. Design UniversalNode data model based on FINDINGS.md recommendations
2. Build category classification using suffix patterns
3. Implement name extraction with field → heuristic fallback

## Critical Insights Discussion

**Session**: 2025-11-26
**Context**: Universal AST Parser - Tree-sitter Exploration Plan v1.0
**Analyst**: AI Clarity Agent
**Reviewer**: Development Team
**Format**: Water Cooler Conversation (5 Critical Insights)

### Insight 1: Grammar Availability Risk

**Did you know**: The plan assumed all 16 languages are in `tree-sitter-language-pack==0.11.0`, but this hadn't been verified—some grammars like Dart, C#, or HCL might not be included or might be lower quality.

**Implications**:
- Some research questions could go unanswered
- Time wasted creating samples for unsupported languages
- Comparison findings biased toward well-supported grammars

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Verify Upfront - Add task to enumerate grammars before samples
- Option B: Best-Effort - Proceed and document failures
- Option C: Reduce Scope - Start with known-good grammars only

**AI Recommendation**: Option A (Verify Upfront)
- Reasoning: 15 minutes of verification could save hours of debugging; proactive is better than reactive for research.

**Discussion Summary**: User chose Option A but wanted output as a proper markdown doc in the exploration folder rather than just a task artifact.

**Decision**: Add P0-T3 task to verify grammar availability and output to `GRAMMAR_AVAILABILITY.md`

**Action Items**:
- [x] Add T000/P0-T3 task to plan
- [x] Add GRAMMAR_AVAILABILITY.md to directory structure

**Affects**: Phase 0 tasks, directory structure

---

### Insight 2: JSON Output Size Problem

**Did you know**: Raw tree-sitter JSON outputs can be thousands of lines for simple files—a 50-line Python class could produce 500+ lines of JSON, making manual analysis of 16 files impractical.

**Implications**:
- Opening JSON files = wall of noise
- Finding structural nodes = needle in haystack
- Cross-format comparison becomes superficial

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Named-Only Filter - Add `--named-only` flag to script
- Option B: Summary Statistics - Create separate summarize script
- Option C: Raw Only - Use jq/grep for ad-hoc filtering
- Option D: Depth Limit - Add `--max-depth` flag

**AI Recommendation**: Option A (Named-Only Filter)
- Reasoning: Research Finding #01 already identified `is_named` as key filter; filtered files 60-70% smaller.

**Discussion Summary**: User chose to generate everything first, then iterate backwards to determine final formats. "Large is fine for now" - maximize data capture, refine later.

**Decision**: Keep full raw output, defer filtering decisions until after seeing real data

**Action Items**: None - proceed with current plan

**Affects**: No changes needed

---

### Insight 3: "Representative" Sample Files Undefined

**Did you know**: Sample tasks say "file contains class, methods, function" but there's no actual checklist—different authors could make different implicit choices, affecting what patterns get discovered.

**Implications**:
- "Representative" is subjective and unverifiable
- Key spec questions might go unanswered if samples miss constructs
- Inconsistent coverage across samples

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Construct Checklist - Define explicit checklist per format
- Option B: Map Spec Questions - Extract required constructs from 10 spec questions
- Option C: Keep Loose - Create reasonable samples, iterate if gaps emerge

**AI Recommendation**: Option B (Map Spec Questions)
- Reasoning: Lightweight approach tied directly to research goals.

**Discussion Summary**: User preferred Option C - stay agile, iterate using jq, work through it as we go.

**Decision**: Keep sample requirements loose, iterate based on actual findings

**Action Items**: None - proceed with current task descriptions

**Affects**: No changes needed

---

### Insight 4: FINDINGS.md Complexity Underestimated

**Did you know**: T038 (write FINDINGS.md) was marked CS-2, but it requires synthesizing 16 JSON outputs, answering 10 spec questions, identifying cross-format patterns, and proposing design approaches—that's CS-3 or higher.

**Implications**:
- T038 is the entire point of the research
- If rushed, whole exploration loses value
- CS-2 label sets wrong expectations

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Re-score to CS-3 - Update complexity and add explicit sub-deliverables
- Option B: Split into Multiple Tasks - Separate analysis by format family
- Option C: Keep As-Is - Accept it's meaty, don't change plan

**AI Recommendation**: Option A (Re-score and Add Structure)
- Reasoning: CS score should reflect reality; explicit sub-deliverables ensure nothing missed.

**Discussion Summary**: User agreed with Option A.

**Decision**: Re-score T038 to CS-3, add explicit deliverables to Notes

**Action Items**:
- [x] Update T038 complexity: CS-2 → CS-3
- [x] Add sub-deliverables to Notes column

**Affects**: Task P1-T36 (formerly T038)

---

### Insight 5: Task Dependency Order Incorrect

**Did you know**: T000 (verify grammar availability) was listed with "Dependencies: --" but actually requires T002 (install dependencies) to run first—you can't enumerate grammars without installing the package.

**Implications**:
- Following task IDs sequentially would cause T000 to fail
- Dependency column contradicted Notes ("Run after T002")
- Sample creation ideally waits for T000 to confirm availability

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Fix Dependencies - Change T000 deps from "--" to "T002"
- Option B: Renumber Tasks - Make IDs match execution order
- Option C: Leave As-Is - Trust human judgment

**AI Recommendation**: Option A (Fix Dependencies)
- Reasoning: Dependency column should be accurate; one small edit fixes it.

**Discussion Summary**: User went further—add a Phase 0 for setup to make the flow explicit. "Violate the 1 phase rule and add phase 0 which is setup."

**Decision**: Create Phase 0 (Setup) and Phase 1 (Exploration) with proper task IDs and dependencies

**Action Items**:
- [x] Add Phases table to plan
- [x] Rename tasks: P0-T1, P0-T2, P0-T3 for setup; P1-T1 through P1-T36 for exploration
- [x] Fix all dependency references

**Affects**: Entire task structure, plan format
